    "essay-responsibility-declaration-content": "Recently, some universities in Germany have begun using artificial intelligence technology to assess the writing of essays. In order to ensure the cooperation agreement between {{tenant}} and our students, we would like to highlight some important matters to our esteemed customers. Our goal is to guide you in producing a high-quality essay that meets your expectations and requirements. This process of assisting you in writing essays consists of 2 steps: 1. In the first step, we will provide profound suggestions on aspects such as content direction, essay structure, and academic writing style incl. use of references. However, please note that our guidance is limited to the direction of the content and overarching principles, and does not include rewriting or compilation. 2. After the completion of the essay, our foreign consultants will proceed to the second step, which involves editing the English text. During this step, we will focus on revising English grammar, without involving any text restructuring or complete rewriting. Rest assured, our English editing process will utilize the reviewing mode feature in Word documents, allowing you to track revisions at any time. We recommend carefully reviewing each revision and deciding whether to accept or reject them. We would be honored if you accept our professional English editing suggestions. Please be aware that while we strive to provide the highest quality service, we cannot guarantee that schools or other institutions will not raise objections regarding plagiarism or the use of artificial intelligence technology in your essay. If for any reason your essay does not meet the standards of the school, we cannot be held responsible, and we ask for your understanding. Thank you for your trust and cooperation. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact us. We look forward to working with you to produce outstanding essays.",
